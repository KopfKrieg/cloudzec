# CloudZec sync #

CloudZec sync (Short „cloudzec“) is a synchronisation solution with end to end encryption, using stable technologies like gpg and sftp.

Theoretically it could be used to sync with any kind of storage, but at the moment there is only sftp-support.

## Warning ##

This is still an early alpha version, full of bugs and features not even the developers know about.
