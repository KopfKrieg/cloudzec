### Ubuntu 14.04 | Debian 8  ###
Installing CloudZec sync on Ubuntu (or Debian) is still not a trivial task due to old versions of the packages and bad python3 support. Anyway, if you really want to try it, follow the instructions:

#### Install the dependencies ####
```sudo apt-get install python3 python3-gnupg python3-crypto python3-ecdsa```

- For notification support install python3-notify2
- For keyring support install python3-keyring

#### Setup paramiko ####
```
wget "http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/paramiko/paramiko-1.13.0.tar.gz"
tar -xf paramiko-1.13.0.tar.gz
mkdir build
cd paramiko-1.13.0/
python3 setup.py install --root="./../build/" --optimize=1
cd ..
```

#### Get CloudZec sync ####
```git clone http://github.com/revogit/cloudzec.git```

#### Throw all in one directory ####
```
mkdir run
mv build/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko run/
cp cloudzec/cloudzec run/cloudzec
cp cloudzec/libcloudzec.py run/libcloudzec.py
```

#### Patch GnuPG in libcloudzec.py ####
Open run/libcloudzec.py in your favourite editor. Search for this line:
```
         self.gpg = gnupg.GPG(binary=binary, homedir=homedir)
```
And replace it with the following:
```
         self.gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=home)
         self.gpg.encoding = 'utf-8'
```
